Little ball guy tries to find matching color 
before the time runs out or he dies. 

I will be completing this project with my team member.

Steps: You are given a set time to find a coinciding color on a raylib board.
You move your circle Character onto the correct color and gain 1 point.
Failing to do so in the set time results in game over. 
After finding the correct color, a new color is chosen for you to find and you are given less time to find it.
This color finding will repeat until you have a game over.

Principles: 
-Polymorphism 
-Encapsulation
-Inheritance
-Abstraction

Classes:
-Character: inherits Game Object
-Movement 
-Color
-Time 
    begins the timer and counts down until player
    
-Points 
-Game Objects: inherits color
-Collisions
